The oceanographer does this by lowering into the water (until completely submerged) a pair of concentric metallic cylinders at the end of a cable and taking data to determine the resistance between these electrodes as a function of depth. The water between the two cylinders forms a cylindrical shell of inner radius a = 1, outer radius b = 2, and length l much larger than 2. The oceanographer applies a potential difference Î”v between the inner and outer surfaces of the cylinders, producing an outward radial current i. Let p represent the resistivity of the water. Calculate the resistance of the water between the cylinders in terms of l, a = 1, b = 2, and p'
