The inner cylinder has radius a, the outer cylinder has radius b, and the length of both cylinders is l, with l >> b. The cable transmits DC power from a battery to the circuit. The battery provides an emf e between the two conductors at one end of both cylinders. A resistor of resistance R is connected between the two conductors at the other end of both cylinders. A current I flows down the inner conductor and back up the outer conductor. The battery charges the inner conductor to a charge âˆ’Q and the outer conductor to a charge +Q. Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field B when r < a, r > b, and a < r < b, in terms of a, b, l, r, I, and R.'
